Project Goals:

Our goal for this project is to create an inventory management database using data that we created to simulate operating a cookie bakery.
Every business must manage its inventory, which uses up a lot of resources. A company would typically allocate the responsibility of inventory management to two or more individuals who will monitor it and make sure that all the goods are on hand. The manager would place the same order if any item was missing. If the organization is small, this technique is effective, but that isn't always the case.

We will create an inventory management system to address this issue for business. Our designs’ objectives would be as follows:

• Increase the inventory turnover

• Improve the stock levels and the inventory.

• Eliminate some of the safe stock levels.

• Obtain inexpensive materials.

• Make it simple to obtain and comprehend.

• Reduce the inventory's running costs (storage cost, insurance cost, etc.)

• Sort the inventory items into categories


Entities and Attributes:

• Bakery

• Raw Materials (Sugar, Milk, Eggs, etc)

• Attributes such as expiry date of inventory/bad product accounting

• Suppliers

• Quantity

• Price per unit

• Units sold
